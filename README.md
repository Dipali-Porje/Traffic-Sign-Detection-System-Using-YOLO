# 🚦 Traffic Sign Detection using YOLO and OpenCV with Text-to-Speech 🔊

A real-time **Traffic Sign Detection System** that uses the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection algorithm and **OpenCV** to identify traffic signs in a video. Once a sign is detected, the system announces it out loud using Python's **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** functionality.

This project is useful for:
- Driver assistance systems
- Educational use in Computer Vision
- Accessibility tools for visually impaired individuals

## ✨ Key Features

✅ Real-time detection of traffic signs like **STOP**, **NO ENTRY**, **SPEED LIMIT**, etc.  
✅ Integrated **Text-to-Speech** functionality using `pyttsx3` to read detected signs aloud  
✅ Works on live webcam feed or video files  
✅ Uses pre-trained **YOLOv4** weights and OpenCV for fast detection
